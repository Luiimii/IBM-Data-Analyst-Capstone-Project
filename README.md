PROJECT SCENARIO

In this project, I worked as if I were a Data Analyst at a global IT consulting firm. My role was to explore the latest technology trends and identify the most in-demand skills for developers.
To do this, I gathered data from multiple sources, including job postings, training platforms, and especially the Stack Overflow Developer Survey.
I then applied web scraping, APIs, and data wrangling techniques to clean and prepare the datasets.
Once the data was ready, I analyzed it to answer key questions such as:

-Which programming languages are most in demand?

-What database technologies are most sought after?

-Which IDEs are the most popular among developers?

I used statistical methods and visualizations to uncover trends and built an interactive dashboard in IBM Cognos Analytics to present the results.
Finally, I summarized the insights in a presentation to highlight the findings and demonstrate my storytelling and data analysis skills.
